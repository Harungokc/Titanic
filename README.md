# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to my Titanic Machine Learning project! This repository explores the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using a variety of machine learning algorithms.

## 🔍 Project Objective

The aim of this project is to apply multiple supervised machine learning algorithms to the famous Titanic dataset in order to predict which passengers survived the disaster.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). It contains information such as:

- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Fare
- Embarked (Port of embarkation)
- Survival (Target Variable)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

This project implements and compares the following models:

- 🌳 Decision Tree
- 🌲 Random Forest
- 🔢 Logistic Regression
- 🤖 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- 📈 Navie Bayes

Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared in terms of accuracy and performance.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Harungokc/Titanic.git
cd Titanic


📈 Model Comparison
A performance comparison of all models is provided at the end of the notebooks. The accuracy and classification reports help to determine which model performs best for this dataset.

📌 Results
Feature engineering and data cleaning significantly improve accuracy.
Random Forest showed the highest predictive performance.
Visualizations help understand feature importance and survival correlations.

🧩 Future Work
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
Cross-validation implementation
Deployment with Streamlit or Flask
Feature selection with PCA
